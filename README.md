# Phaser Micro

Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers.

This version of Phaser is an experimental build designed to be the absolute bare-minimum, while still including Canvas and WebGL batched rendering. The objective is to keep it powerful enough that it's still generally useful, but small enough that it can be used for super-low byte size environments such as banner ads.
