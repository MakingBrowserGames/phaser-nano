# Phaser Micro

Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers.

Phaser Micro is a highly optimized and absolute bare minimum version of its parent framework. Designed specifically to be extremely powerful and flexible, but small enough to be used in super-low byte size environments such as banner ads and interstitials.
